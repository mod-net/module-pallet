## Purpose

Implement comprehensive Docker containerization for the Mod-Net module pallet project to enable consistent development environments and streamlined production deployments.

## Technical Details

### Current State
- Basic Dockerfile exists but uses generic Polkadot template
- No Docker Compose setup for local development
- No multi-stage builds for optimization
- Missing environment-specific configurations

### Required Implementation

#### 1. Multi-Stage Dockerfile
- **Builder stage**: Rust compilation with proper caching
- **Runtime stage**: Minimal production image
- **Development stage**: Include debugging tools and hot-reload capabilities

#### 2. Docker Compose Setup
```yaml
# Required services:
- substrate-node (main blockchain node)
- ipfs (local IPFS node)
- postgres (for off-chain data)
- monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana stack)
```

#### 3. Environment Configurations
- Development environment with hot-reload
- Testing environment for CI/CD
- Production-ready configuration with security hardening

#### 4. Build Optimization
- Multi-platform builds (AMD64, ARM64)
- Layer caching strategies
- Dependency caching for faster rebuilds
- WASM target compilation optimization

### Implementation Requirements

#### Dockerfile Improvements
- [ ] Update base images to latest stable versions
- [ ] Implement proper multi-stage builds
- [ ] Add health checks for container orchestration
- [ ] Optimize for smaller image sizes
- [ ] Include proper user management (non-root execution)

#### Docker Compose Services
- [ ] Substrate node with proper networking
- [ ] IPFS service with persistent volumes
- [ ] PostgreSQL with initialization scripts
- [ ] Redis for caching (if needed)
- [ ] Monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana)

#### Development Experience
- [ ] Hot-reload for Rust development
- [ ] Volume mounts for source code
- [ ] Environment variable management
- [ ] Easy database seeding/migration

#### Production Readiness
- [ ] Security scanning integration
- [ ] Resource limits and requests
- [ ] Logging configuration
- [ ] Backup strategies for volumes

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `docker-compose up` starts complete development environment
- [ ] Production Dockerfile builds optimized image (<500MB)
- [ ] All services communicate properly through Docker networks
- [ ] Persistent data survives container restarts
- [ ] Health checks work for all services
- [ ] Documentation updated with Docker usage instructions
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline builds and tests Docker images
- [ ] Multi-platform images published to registry

### Files to Create/Modify

- `Dockerfile` (update existing)
- `docker-compose.yml` (new)
- `docker-compose.prod.yml` (new)
- `.dockerignore` (new)
- `scripts/docker-setup.sh` (new)
- `docs/DOCKER.md` (new)
- `.github/workflows/docker.yml` (new)

### Dependencies

- Docker Engine 20.10+
- Docker Compose 2.0+
- Multi-platform build support

### Priority: High
This enables consistent development environments and simplifies deployment processes, directly supporting the macro-goal of creating a robust, maintainable module pallet system.
